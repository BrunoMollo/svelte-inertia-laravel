# Migrations and factories
- A when creating a new model, you should create a migration and a factory (use the `php artisan make:model -mf` command)
- You shoud always keep the factories up to date with the migrations. If a model is change, the factory should be changed too.


# Naming & Structure
- Use singular, StudlyCase names (User, InvoiceItem).
- Match table name only when deviating from Laravel conventions.
- Keep models thin; extract logic when the file grows large

# Boolean columns
- Try to avoid boolean columns, in many cases they are an over simplification that
hides information. For example, a `is_active` column is better represented as a `acticated_at` column.
- you can create methods to simplify the logic of the column to a boolean result.
